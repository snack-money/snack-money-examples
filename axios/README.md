# Snack Money x402-axios Example

This example demonstrates how to send USDC payments to X (Twitter) users using the Snack Money API with x402-axios.

## Features

- Multi-network support (Base and Solana)
- Automatic x402 payment negotiation
- Simple axios-based API
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- USDC balance on Base or Solana
- Private keys for both networks

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Add your configuration to `.env`:
```env
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
SVM_PRIVATE_KEY=your_solana_private_key_base58
RECEIVER=USE_YOUR_OWN_X_ACCOUNT
AMOUNT=0.01
```

**Note**: Use your own X (Twitter) account as the receiver to test the integration.

## Usage

Build and run the example:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or build separately:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## How it works

1. Creates signers for both Base and Solana networks
2. Wraps axios with the x402 payment interceptor
3. Makes a POST request to `/payments/x/pay`
4. The interceptor handles the 402 Payment Required response
5. Executes the payment on the appropriate network
6. Retries the request with payment proof
7. Returns the successful response

## Testing

Start with a small amount (0.01 USDC = 1¢) to test the integration.

## Example Output
